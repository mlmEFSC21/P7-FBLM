In this project, you will learn about the Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module. 
Requirements:
Read A Complete Guide to Flexbox (Links to an external site.) by Chris Coyier.
Use the first two code examples (from the Example section of the CSS-Tricks webpage) to help you create a single web page that contains the following:
a right-aligned navigation element on the very top of your website, that will be centered on medium-sized screens and single-columned on small devices.
a list of 6 items with fixed dimensions that can also be auto-sized
Be as creative as you like with the content of your web page. See above figure as a decent example.
